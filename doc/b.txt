Our Solution: Building the Connection

    Developed Ontology-Based Knowledge Graph to define & link components, defects, repairs, rules.

    Reused REO patterns (Information, Spatial) for enterprise alignment.

    Automatically connected previously siloed data (scans, FEA, rules, model).

Key Outputs: Integrated Insight

    Enabled SPARQL queries to instantly retrieve integrated defect & repair data.

    Visualized contextually on 3D model & unified table.

    Provides complete picture for analysis (previously unavailable).

Value & Impact

    Faster, Informed Decisions (Accelerated analysis).

    Improved Accuracy & Consistency (Ontology-linked data).

    Unified, Contextual View (Single source of truth).

    Foundation for Standardization (Machine-readable descriptions).

    Built Internal Capability (Trained 28 PW/AF personnel).

    Validated & Approved for Next Phase (Positive AF feedback).
