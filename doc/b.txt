The Challenge: Disconnected Airfoil Data

    Fragmented Information: Critical inspection measurements (scans), repair procedures (FEA simulations/JSON), engineering rules (text), and 3D models exist in separate, isolated files.

    Manual Data Handling: Engineers spend significant time manually finding, matching, interpreting, and exchanging these disparate data files between PW & AF.

    Operational Impact: This manual process leads to:

        Slowed Decisions: Delays in critical maintenance and repair choices.

        Increased Risk: Higher potential for errors due to manual interpretation.

        Inefficiency: Difficulty achieving a holistic view for streamlined operations.
